    "\n",
    "1. Set up a new ***private*** repository on https://github.com/ called \"`cmse202-f18-hw1`\".\n",
    "2. Add your Professor and your TA as collaborators with \"Read\" access to your repository so that we can see your assignment. For Section 001, you should add users \"devinsilvia\" and \"rmlarose\". For Section 002, you should add users \"pguthrey\" and \"rmlarose\".\n",

    "7. Finally, to test that everything is working, \"git push\" the file so that it ends up in your GitHub repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "If everything went as intended, the file should now show up on your GitHub account in the \"`cmse202-f18-hw1`\" repository that you just created.  Periodically, **you'll be asked to commit your changes to the repository and push them to the remote GitHub location**. Of course, you can always commit your changes more often than that, if you wish.  It can be good to get into a habit of committing your changes any time you make a significant modification, or when you stop working on the project for a bit."
